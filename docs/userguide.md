# User Guide

If this is your first time using Flyte, check out the {doc}`Getting Started <index>` guide.

This _User Guide_, the {doc}`Tutorials <tutorials>` and the {doc}`Integrations <integrations>` examples cover all of
the key features of Flyte for data analytics, data science and machine learning practitioners, organized by topic. Each
section below introduces a core feature of Flyte and how you can use it to address specific use cases. Code for all
of the examples can be found in the [flytesnacks repo](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks).

It comes with a specific environment to make running, documenting
and contributing samples easy. If this is your first time running these examples, follow the
{doc}`environment setup guide <environment_setup>` to get started.

```{tip}
To learn about how to spin up and manage a Flyte cluster in the cloud, see the
