# Flyte Fundamentals

This section of the **Getting Started** documentation will take you through the
fundamental concepts of Flyte: tasks, workflows, and launch plans.

You'll learn about the full development lifecycle of creating a project,
registering workflows, and running them on a demo Flyte cluster. These
guides will also walk you through how to visualize artifacts associated with
tasks, optimize them for scale and performance, and extend Flyte for your own
use cases.
