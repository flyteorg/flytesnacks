# Getting started with workflow development

At the heart of machine learning, data engineering, and data analytics is the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of processes that consume, transform, and output data. Flyte enables you to develop and test your DAGs locally in a production-like environment by creating a Flyte project to contain the task and workflow code that defines your DAG, as well as the configuration files needed to package your code to run on a local or remote Flyte cluster.
