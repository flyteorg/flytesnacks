# Core Use Cases

This section of the **Getting Started** documentation will take you through the
core use cases that Flyte is designed for. Within the context of these guides,
we're going to assume that the discipline of data science can be broken down into
at least three specializations: data engineering, machine learning (or
statistical modeling more broadly), and analytics.

The purpose of these guides is to provide you, the data and ML practitioner,
some practical and simple examples of how Flyte can help you in your daily
practice.
