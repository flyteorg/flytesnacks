# Flyte agents

In Flyte, an agent is a long-running, stateless service powered by a gRPC server.
Each agent service is a Kubernetes deployment that receives gRPC requests from FlytePropeller
when users trigger a particular type of task (for example, the BigQuery agent handles BigQuery tasks).
The agent service then initiates a job with the appropriate external service.
You can create different agent services that host different agents, e.g., a production and a development agent service.
