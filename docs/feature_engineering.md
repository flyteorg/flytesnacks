# Feature Engineering

**Feature Engineering** is an essential part of Machine Learning. Itss the process
of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem
to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.

Explore how features can be engineered with the power of Flyte.
