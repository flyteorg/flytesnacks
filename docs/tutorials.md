# Tutorials

This section showcases step-by-step case studies of how to combine the different
features of Flyte to achieve everything from data processing, feature engineering,
model training, to batch predictions. Code for all of the examples in the user
guide can be found in the [flytesnacks](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks) repo.

It comes with a highly customized environment to make running, documenting and
contributing samples easy. If this is your first time running these examples, follow the
{ref}`setup guide <env_setup>` to get started.
