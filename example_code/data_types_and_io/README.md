# Data Types and IO

These examples introduce the wide range of data types that Flyte supports.
These types serve a dual purpose by not only validating the data but also enabling seamless
transfer of data between local and cloud storage.
They enable:

- Data lineage
- Memoization
- Auto parallelization
- Simplifying access to data
- Auto generated CLI and launch UI
