FlyteSnacks: A Flytekit tutorial
############################################

The intention of this cookbook is to provide a hands on tutorial of various
features in Flyte (specifically if you are using flytekit-python). Flytekit is
intended to be useful even without Flyte backend. All the examples in the
following set are executable locally and we recommend the best way to try out
Flyte is to run these examples locally. The tutorial is divided into 4 sections

``Basic``, ``Intermediate`` & ``Advanced`` sections are laid out in varying levels of difficulty.
``Working with Hosted Flyte Service`` is an independent section and can be used with any of the difficulty
level sections.
