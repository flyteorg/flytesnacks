07: Mock Tasks for Testing
--------------------------

A lot of the tasks that you write you can run locally, but some of them you will not be able to, usually because they
are tasks that depend on a third-party only available on the backend. Hive tasks are a common example, as most users
will not have access to the service that executes Hive queries from their development environment. However, it's still
useful to be able to locally run a workflow that calls such a task. In these instances, flytekit provides a couple
of utilities to help navigate this.
