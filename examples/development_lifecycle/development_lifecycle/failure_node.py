#
# The Failure Node feature enables you to designate a specific node to execute in the event of a failure within your workflow.
#
# For example, workflow involves creating a cluster at the beginning, followed by the execution of tasks, and concluding
# with the deletion of the cluster once all tasks are completed. However, if any task within the workflow encounters an error,
# flyte will abort the entire workflow and wonâ€™t delete the cluster. This poses a challenge if you still need to clean up the
# cluster even in a task failure.
#
# A failure node can be incorporated into the workflow to address this issue. This ensures that critical actions,
# such as deleting the cluster, are executed even in the event of failures occurring throughout the workflow execution.
