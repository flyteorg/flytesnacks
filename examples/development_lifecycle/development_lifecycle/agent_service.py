# ## What is an Agent?
#
# In Flyte, an Agent is a long-running stateless service that can be used to execute tasks. It reduces the overhead of creating a pod for each task.
# In addition, it's easy to scale up and down the agent service based on the workload. Agent services are designed to be language-agnostic.
# For now, we only support Python agent, but we may support other languages in the future.
#
# Agent is designed to run a specific type of task. For example, you can create a BigQuery agent to run BigQuery task. Therefore, if you create a new type of task, you can
# either run the task in the pod, or you can create a new agent to run it. You can determine how the task will be executed in the FlytePropeller configMap.
#
# Key goals of the agent service include:
#
# - Support for communication with external services: The focus is on enabling agents that seamlessly interact with external services.
# - Independent testing and private deployment: Agents can be tested independently and deployed privately, providing flexibility and control over development.
# - Flyte Agent usage in local development: Users, especially in flytekit and unionml, can leverage backend agents for local development, streamlining the development process.
# - Language-agnostic: Agents can be authored in any programming language, allowing users to work with their preferred language and tools.
# - Scalability: Agents are designed to be scalable, ensuring they can handle large-scale workloads effectively.
# - Simple API: Agents offer a straightforward API, making integration and usage straightforward for developers.
#
# ## Why do we need an Agent Service?
#
# Without Agents, people need to implement a backend plugin in the propeller. The backend plugin is responsible for
# creating a CRD and submitting a http request to the external service. However, it increases the complexity of flytepropeller, and
# it's hard to maintain the backend plugin. For example, if we want to add a new plugin, we need to update and compile
# flytepropeller, and it's also hard to test. In addition, the backend plugin is running in flytepropeller itself, so it
# increases the load of the flytepropeller engine.
#
# Furthermore, implementing backend plugins can be challenging, particularly for data scientists and ML engineers who may lack proficiency in
# Golang. Additionally, managing performance requirements, maintenance, and development can be burdensome.
# To address these issues, we introduced the "Agent Service" in Flyte. This system enables rapid plugin
# development while decoupling them from the core flytepropeller engine.
#
# ## Overview
#
# The Flyte Agent Service is a Python-based agent registry powered by a gRPC server. It allows users and flytepropeller
# to send gRPC requests to the registry for executing jobs such as BigQuery and Databricks. Each Agent service is a Kubernetes
# deployment. You can create two different Agent services hosting different Agents. For example, you can create one production
# agent service and one development agent service.

# ## How to register a new agent
#
# ### Flytekit interface specification
#
# To register a new agent, you can extend the `AgentBase` class in the flytekit backend module. Implementing the following three methods is necessary, and it's important to ensure that all calls are idempotent:
#
# - `create`: This method is used to initiate a new task. Users have the flexibility to use gRPC, REST, or an SDK to create a task.
# - `get`: This method allows retrieving the job Resource (jobID or output literal) associated with the task, such as a BigQuery Job ID or Databricks task ID.
# - `delete`: Invoking this method will send a request to delete the corresponding job.
#
# ```python
# from flytekit.extend.backend.base_agent import AgentBase, AgentRegistry
# from dataclasses import dataclass
# import requests
#
# @dataclass
# class Metadata:
#     # you can add any metadata you want, propeller will pass the metadata to the agent to get the job status.
#     # For example, you can add the job_id to the metadata, and the agent will use the job_id to get the job status.
#     # You could also add the s3 file path, and the agent can check if the file exists.
#     job_id: str
#
# class CustomAgent(AgentBase):
#     def __init__(self, task_type: str):
#         # Each agent should have a unique task type. Agent service will use the task type to find the corresponding agent.
#         self._task_type = task_type
#
#     def create(
#         self,
#         context: grpc.ServicerContext,
#         output_prefix: str,
#         task_template: TaskTemplate,
#         inputs: typing.Optional[LiteralMap] = None,
#     ) -> TaskCreateResponse:
#         # 1. Submit the task to the external service (BigQuery, DataBricks, etc.)
#         # 2. Create a task metadata such as jobID.
#         # 3. Return the task metadata, and keep in mind that the metadata should be serialized to bytes.
#         res = requests.post(url, json=data)
#         return CreateTaskResponse(resource_meta=json.dumps(asdict(Metadata(job_id=str(res.job_id)))).encode("utf-8"))
#
#     def get(self, context: grpc.ServicerContext, resource_meta: bytes) -> TaskGetResponse:
#         # 1. Deserialize the metadata.
#         # 2. Use the metadata to get the job status.
#         # 3. Return the job status.
#         metadata = Metadata(**json.loads(resource_meta.decode("utf-8")))
#         res = requests.get(url, json={"job_id": metadata.job_id})
#         return GetTaskResponse(resource=Resource(state=res.state)
#
#     def delete(self, context: grpc.ServicerContext, resource_meta: bytes) -> TaskDeleteResponse:
#         # 1. Deserialize the metadata.
#         # 2. Use the metadata to delete the job.
#         # 3. If failed to delete the job, add the error message to the grpc context.
#         #   context.set_code(grpc.StatusCode.INTERNAL)
#         #   context.set_details(f"failed to create task with error {e}")
#         try:
#             metadata = Metadata(**json.loads(resource_meta.decode("utf-8")))
#             requests.delete(url, json={"job_id": metadata.job_id})
#         except Exception as e:
#             logger.error(f"failed to delete task with error {e}")
#             context.set_code(grpc.StatusCode.INTERNAL)
#             context.set_details(f"failed to delete task with error {e}")
#         return DeleteTaskResponse()
#
# # To register the custom agent
# AgentRegistry.register(CustomAgent())
# ```
#
# Here is an example of [BigQuery Agent](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/9977aac26242ebbede8e00d476c2fbc59ac5487a/plugins/flytekit-bigquery/flytekitplugins/bigquery/agent.py#L35) implementation.
#
# ### How to test the agent
#
# Agent can be tested locally without running backend server. It makes the development of the agent easier.
#
# The task inherited from AsyncAgentExecutorMixin can be executed locally, allowing flytekit to mimic the propeller's behavior to call the agent.
# In some cases, you should store credentials in your local environment when testing locally.
# For example, you need to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable when testing the BigQuery task.
# After setting up the CREDENTIALS, you can run the task locally. Flytekit will automatically call the agent to create, get, or delete the task.
#
# ```python
# bigquery_doge_coin = BigQueryTask(
#     name=f"bigquery.doge_coin",
#     inputs=kwtypes(version=int),
#     query_template="SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_dogecoin.transactions` WHERE version = @version LIMIT 10;",
#     output_structured_dataset_type=StructuredDataset,
#     task_config=BigQueryConfig(ProjectID="flyte-test-340607")
# )
# ```
#
# Task above task as an example, you can run the task locally and test agent with the following command:
#
# ```bash
# pyflyte run wf.py bigquery_doge_coin --version 10
# ```
#
# ### Build a New image

# ### Update FlyteAgent
#
# 1. Update the FlyteAgent deployment's [image](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/blob/201a8e1450d86b72a67be938ce7502ee2621cadb/charts/flyte-core/templates/agent/deployment.yaml#L27)
# 2. Update the FlytePropeller configmap.
#
# ```YAML
# tasks:
#   task-plugins:
#     enabled-plugins:
#       - agent-service
#     default-for-task-types:
#       - bigquery_query_job_task: agent-service
#       - custom_task: agent-service
#
# plugins:
#   agent-service:
#     supportedTaskTypes:
#       - bigquery_query_job_task
#       - default_task
#       - custom_task
#     # By default, all the request will be sent to the default agent.
#     defaultAgent:
#       endpoint: "dns:///flyteagent.flyte.svc.cluster.local:8000"
#       insecure: true
#       timeouts:
#         GetTask: 200ms
#       defaultTimeout: 50ms
#     agents:
#       custom_agent:
#         endpoint: "dns:///custom-flyteagent.flyte.svc.cluster.local:8000"

#         defaultServiceConfig: '{"loadBalancingConfig": [{"round_robin":{}}]}'
#         timeouts:
#           GetTask: 100ms
#         defaultTimeout: 20ms
#     agentForTaskTypes:
#       # It will override the default agent for custom_task, which means propeller will send the request to this agent.
#       - custom_task: custom_agent
# ```
#
# 3. Restart the FlytePropeller
#
# ```
# kubectl rollout restart deployment flytepropeller -n flyte
