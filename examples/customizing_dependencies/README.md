# Customizing Dependencies

In this section, you will uncover how Flyte utilizes Docker images to construct containers under the hood,
and you'll learn how to craft your own images to encompass all the necessary dependencies for your tasks or workflows.
You will explore how to execute a raw container with custom commands,
indicate multiple container images within a single workflow,
and get familiar with the ins and outs of `ImageSpec`!
