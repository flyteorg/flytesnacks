# OpenAI Batch Agent

```{eval-rst}
.. tags:: Integration, Intermediate, OpenAI
```

The Batch API agent allows you to submit requests for asynchronous batch processing on OpenAI.
You can provide either a JSONL file or a JSON iterator, and the agent handles the upload to OpenAI,
creation of the batch, and downloading of the output and error files.

## Installation

To use the OpenAI Batch agent, run the following command:

```
pip install flytekitplugins-openai
```

## Example usage

For a usage example, see {doc}`OpenAI Batch agent example usage <openai_batch_agent_example_usage>`.

## Local testing

To test an agent locally, create a class for the agent task that inherits from
[SyncAgentExecutorMixin](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/master/flytekit/extend/backend/base_agent.py#L222-L256)
or [AsyncAgentExecutorMixin](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/master/flytekit/extend/backend/base_agent.py#L259-L354).
These mixins can handle synchronous and synchronous tasks, respectively,
and allow flytekit to mimic FlytePropeller's behavior in calling the agent.
For more information, see "[Testing agents locally](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/flyte_agents/testing_agents_locally.html)".

## Flyte deployment configuration

```{note}
If you are using a managed deployment of Flyte, you will need to contact your deployment administrator to configure agents in your deployment.
```

To enable the OpenAI Batch agent in your Flyte deployment, refer to the
{ref}`OpenAI Batch agent setup guide <deployment-agent-setup-openai-batch>`.
