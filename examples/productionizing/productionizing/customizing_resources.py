# # Customizing Task Resources
#

# .. tags:: Deployment, Infrastructure, Basic

#
# One of the reasons to use a hosted Flyte environment is the potential of leveraging CPU, memory and storage resources, far greater than what's available locally.
# Flytekit makes it possible to specify these requirements declaratively and close to where the task itself is declared.

# %% [markdown]
# In this example, the memory required by the function increases as the dataset size increases.
# Large datasets may not be able to run locally, so we would want to provide hints to the Flyte backend to request for more memory.
# This is done by decorating the task with the hints as shown in the following code sample.
#
# Tasks can have `requests` and `limits` which mirror the native [equivalents in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits).
# A task can possibly be allocated more resources than it requests, but never more than its limit.
# Requests are treated as hints to schedule tasks on nodes with available resources, whereas limits
# are hard constraints.
#
# For either a request or limit, refer to the {py:class}`flytekit:flytekit.Resources` documentation.
#
# The following attributes can be specified for a `Resource`.
#
# 1. `cpu`
# 2. `mem`
# 3. `gpu`
#
# To ensure that regular tasks that don't require GPUs are not scheduled on GPU nodes, a separate node group for GPU nodes can be configured with [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).
#
# To ensure that tasks that require GPUs get the needed tolerations on their pods, set up FlytePropeller using the following [configuration](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytepropeller/blob/v0.10.5/config.yaml#L51,L56). Ensure that this toleration config matches the taint config you have configured to protect your GPU providing nodes from dealing with regular non-GPU workloads (pods).
#
# The actual values follow the [Kubernetes convention](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes).
# Let's look at an example to understand how to customize resources.

# You can see the memory allocation below. The memory limit is `500Mi` rather than `350Mi`, and the
# CPU limit is 4, whereas it should have been 6 as specified using `with_overrides`.
# This is because the default platform CPU quota for every pod is 4.

# Another example for using `with_overrides` method to override the `task_config`.
# In the following we take TF Trainning for example.

# To create a TensorFlow task, add {py:class}`flytekitplugins:flytekitplugins.kftensorflow.TfJob` config to the Flyte task, that is a plugin can run distributed TensorFlow training on Kubernetes.
