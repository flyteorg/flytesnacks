# Snowflake agent

```{eval-rst}
.. tags:: AWS, GCP, AliCloud, Integration, Advanced
```
Flyte can be seamlessly integrated with the [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com) service,
providing you with a straightforward means to query data in Snowflake.

## Installation

To use the Snowflake agent, run the following command:

```
pip install flytekitplugins-snowflake
```

## Example usage

For a usage example, see {doc}`Snowflake agent example usage<snowflake_agent_example_usage>`.

## Local testing

To test the Snowflake agent locally, create a class for the agent task that inherits from [AsyncAgentExecutorMixin](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/master/flytekit/extend/backend/base_agent.py#L262). This mixin can handle asynchronous tasks and allows flytekit to mimic FlytePropeller's behavior in calling the agent. For more information, see "[Testing agents locally](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/flyte_agents/testing_agents_locally.html)".

```{note}

In some cases, you will need to store credentials in your local environment when testing locally.

```

## Flyte deployment configuration

```{note}
If you are using a managed deployment of Flyte, you will need to contact your deployment administrator to configure agents in your deployment.
```

To enable the Snowflake agent in your Flyte deployment, see the {ref}`Snowflake agent setup guide <deployment-agent-setup-snowflake>`.
