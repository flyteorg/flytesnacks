# Flyte enforces type safety by utilizing type information for compiling tasks and workflows,
# enabling various features such as static analysis and conditional branching.
#
# However, we also strive to offer flexibility to end-users so they don't have to invest heavily
# in understanding their data structures upfront before experiencing the value Flyte has to offer.
#
# Flyte supports the `FlytePickle` transformer, which converts any unrecognized type hint into `FlytePickle`,
# enabling the serialization/deserialization of Python values to/from a pickle file.
#
# :::{important}
# Pickle can only be used to send objects between the exact same Python version.
# For optimal performance, it's advisable to either employ Python types that are supported by Flyte
# or register a custom transformer, as using pickle types can result in lower performance.
# :::
#
# This example demonstrates how you can utilize custom objects without registering a transformer.

# %% [markdown]
# `Superhero` represents a user-defined complex type that can be serialized to a pickle file by Flytekit
# and transferred between tasks as both input and output data.
#
# :::{note}
# Alternatively, you can {ref}`turn this object into a dataclass <dataclass>` for improved performance.
# We have used a simple object here for demonstration purposes.

# ## Batch size
#
# By default, if the list subtype is unrecognized, a single pickle file is generated.
# To optimize serialization and deserialization performance for scenarios involving a large number of items
# or significant list elements, you can specify a batch size.
# This feature allows for the processing of each batch as a separate pickle file.
# The following example demonstrates how to set the batch size.

# The `welcome_superheroes` task will generate two pickle files: one containing two superheroes and the other containing one superhero.
