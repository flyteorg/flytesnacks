# A checkpoint in Flyte serves to recover a task from a previous failure by preserving the task's state before the failure
# and resuming from the latest recorded state.
#
# ## Why intra-task checkpoints?
#
# The inherent design of Flyte, being a workflow engine, allows users to break down operations, programs or ideas
# into smaller tasks within workflows. In the event of a task failure, the workflow doesn't need to rerun the
# previously completed tasks. Instead, it can retry the specific task that encountered an issue.
# Once the problematic task succeeds, it won't be rerun. Consequently, the natural boundaries between tasks act as implicit checkpoints.
#
# However, there are scenarios where breaking a task into smaller tasks is either challenging or undesirable due to the associated overhead.
# This is especially true when running a substantial computation in a tight loop.
# In such cases, users may consider splitting each loop iteration into individual tasks using dynamic workflows.
# Yet, the overhead of spawning new tasks, recording intermediate results, and reconstructing the state can incur additional expenses.
#
# ### Use case: Model training
#
# An exemplary scenario illustrating the utility of intra-task checkpointing is during model training.
# In situations where executing multiple epochs or iterations with the same dataset might be time-consuming,
# setting task boundaries can incur a high bootstrap time and be costly.
#
# Flyte addresses this challenge by providing a mechanism to checkpoint progress within a task execution,
# saving it as a file or set of files. In the event of a failure, the checkpoint file can be re-read to
# resume most of the state without rerunning the entire task.
# This feature opens up possibilities to leverage alternate, more cost-effective compute systems,
# such as [AWS spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/),
# [GCP pre-emptible instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible) and others.
#
# These instances offer great performance at significantly lower price points compared to their on-demand or reserved counterparts.
# This becomes feasible when tasks are constructed in a fault-tolerant manner.
# For tasks running within a short duration, e.g., less than 10 minutes, the likelihood of failure is negligible,
# and task-boundary-based recovery provides substantial fault tolerance for successful completion.
#
# However, as the task execution time increases, the cost of re-running it also increases,
# reducing the chances of successful completion. This is precisely where Flyte's intra-task checkpointing proves to be highly beneficial.
#
# Here's an example illustrating how to develop tasks that leverage intra-task checkpointing.
# It's important to note that Flyte currently offers the low-level API for checkpointing.
# Future integrations aim to incorporate higher-level checkpointing APIs from popular training frameworks
# like Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and big-data frameworks such as Spark and Flink, enhancing their fault-tolerance capabilities.
#
# To begin, import the necessary libraries and set the number of task retries to `3`.

            raise FlyteRecoverableException(f"Failed at iteration {index}, failure_interval {failure_interval}.")
