# # Running Ray Tasks
#
# The Ray task offers the capability to execute a Ray job either on a pre-existing Ray cluster
# or by creating a new Ray cluster using the Ray operator.
#
# :::{Warning}
# **Version Compatibility**
# - flyte >= 1.11.1-b1 only works with kuberay 1.1.0
# - Although flyte < 1.11.0 can work with kuberay 0.6.0 and 1.1.0, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest flyte and kuberay 1.1.0 for stability and usability
# :::
#
# To begin, load the libraries.

from flytekit import ImageSpec, Resources, task, workflow

# %% [markdown]
# Create an `ImageSpec` to encompass all the dependencies needed for the Ray task.

)

# %% [markdown]
# :::{important}
# Replace `ghcr.io/flyteorg` with a container registry you've access to publish to.
# To upload the image to the local registry in the demo cluster, indicate the registry as `localhost:30000`.

# The following imports are required to configure the Ray cluster in Flyte.
# You can load them on demand.

# %% [markdown]
# In this example, we define a [remote function](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks.html#tasks)
# that will be executed asynchronously in the Ray cluster.

# {py:class}`~flytekitplugins.ray.WorkerNodeConfig` in {py:class}`~flytekitplugins.ray.RayJobConfig`.
# These configurations will subsequently be employed by the Ray operator to establish a Ray cluster before task execution.
#
# Here's a breakdown of the parameters:
#
# - `ray_start_params`: These are the [parameters](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/api/doc/ray.init.html)
#   used in the Ray `init` method, encompassing the address and object-store-memory settings.
# - `replicas`: Specifies the desired number of replicas for the worker group. The default is 1.
# - `group_name`: A RayCluster can host multiple worker groups, each differentiated by its name.
# - `runtime_env`: The [runtime environment](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/handling-dependencies.html#runtime-environments)
#   definition outlines the necessary dependencies for your Ray application to function.
#   This environment is dynamically installed on the cluster at runtime.

    runtime_env={"pip": ["numpy", "pandas"]},  # or runtime_env="./requirements.txt"
)


# %% [markdown]
# Create a Ray task. The task is invoked on the Ray head node, while `f.remote(i)` executes asynchronously on distinct Ray workers.

    return ray.get(futures)


# %% [markdown]
# :::{note}
# The `Resources` section here is utilized to specify the resources allocated to the worker nodes.
# :::
#
# Lastly, define a workflow to call the Ray task.
# %%
@workflow

    return ray_task(n=n)

# You have the option to execute the code locally,
# during which Flyte generates a self-contained Ray cluster on your local environment.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Troubleshoot
#
# If you observe that the head and worker pods are not being generated, you need to ensure that `ray[default]` is installed since it supports
# the cluster and dashboard launcher.
#
# Another potential error might involve ingress issues, as indicated in the kuberay-operator logs.
# If you encounter an error resembling the following:
#
# ````
# ERROR controllers.RayCluster Ingress create error!
# {
#     "Ingress.Error": "Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io": failed to call webhook: Post "<https://nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-admission.default.svc:443/networking/v1/ingresses?timeout=10s>": no endpoints available for service "nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-admission"",
#     "error": "Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io": failed to call webhook: Post "<https://nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-admission.default.svc:443/networking/v1/ingresses?timeout=10s>": no endpoints available for service "nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller-admission""
# }
# ````
#
# You must ensure that the ingress controller is [installed](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/gcp/manual.html#ingress).
