#
# A task serves as the fundamental building block and an extension point within Flyte.
# It exhibits the following characteristics:
#
# 1. Versioned (typically aligned with the git sha)
# 2. Strong interfaces (annotated inputs and outputs)
# 3. Declarative
# 4. Independently executable
# 5. Suitable for unit testing
#
# A Flyte task operates within its own container and and runs on a [Kubernetes pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).
# It can be classified into two types:
#
# 1. A task associated with a Python function. Executing the task is the same as executing the function.
# 2. A task without a Python function, such as a SQL query or a portable task like prebuilt
#    algorithms in SageMaker, or a service calling an API.
#
# Flyte offers numerous plugins for tasks, including backend plugins like
# [Athena](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/master/plugins/flytekit-aws-athena/flytekitplugins/athena/task.py).
#
# This example demonstrates how to write and execute a
# [Python function task](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/master/flytekit/core/python_function_task.py#L75).
#
# To begin, import `task` from the `flytekit` library.
# %%
from flytekit import task


# %% [markdown]
# The use of the {py:func}`~flytekit.task` decorator is mandatory for a ``PythonFunctionTask``.
# A task is essentially a regular Python function, with the exception that all inputs and outputs must be clearly annotated with their types.
# Learn more about the supported types in the {ref}`type-system section <flytekit_to_flyte_type_mapping>`.
#
# We create a task that computes the slope of a regression line.
# %%
@task
def slope(x: list[int], y: list[int]) -> float:
    sum_xy = sum([x[i] * y[i] for i in range(len(x))])
    sum_x_squared = sum([x[i] ** 2 for i in range(len(x))])
    n = len(x)
    return (n * sum_xy - sum(x) * sum(y)) / (n * sum_x_squared - sum(x) ** 2)


# %% [markdown]
# :::{note}
# Flytekit will assign a default name to the output variable like `out0`.
# In case of multiple outputs, each output will be numbered in the order
# starting with 0, e.g., -> `out0, out1, out2, ...`.
# :::
#
# You can execute a Flyte task just like any regular Python function.
# %%
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(slope(x=[-3, 0, 3], y=[7, 4, -2]))

# %% [markdown]
# :::{note}
# When invoking a Flyte task, you need to use keyword arguments to specify
# the values for the corresponding parameters.
# :::
#
# (single_task_execution)=
#
# To run it locally, you can use the following `pyflyte run` command:
# ```
# pyflyte run \
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks/master/examples/01_basics/01_basics/task.py \
#   slope --x '[-3,0,3]' --y '[7,4,-2]'
# ```
#
# If you want to run it remotely on the Flyte cluster,
# simply add the `--remote flag` to the `pyflyte run` command:
# ```
# pyflyte run --remote \
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks/master/examples/01_basics/01_basics/task.py \
#   slope --x '[-3,0,3]' --y '[7,4,-2]'
# ```
