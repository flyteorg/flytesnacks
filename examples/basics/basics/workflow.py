#
# Workflows link multiple tasks together. They can be written as Python functions,
# but it's important to distinguish tasks and workflows.
#
# A task's body executes at run-time on a Kubernetes cluster, in a Query Engine like BigQuery,
# or on hosted services like AWS Batch or Sagemaker.
#
# In contrast, a workflow's body doesn't perform computations; it's used to structure tasks.
# A workflow's body executes at registration time, during the workflow's registration process.
# Registration involves uploading the packaged (serialized) code to the Flyte backend,
# enabling the workflow to be triggered.
#
# For more information, see the {std:ref}`registration documentation <flyte:divedeep-registration>`.
#
# To begin, import {py:func}`~flytekit.task` and {py:func}`~flytekit.workflow` from the flytekit library.

# We define `slope` and `intercept` tasks to compute the slope and
# intercept of the regression line, respectively.

def slope(x: list[int], y: list[int]) -> float:
    sum_xy = sum([x[i] * y[i] for i in range(len(x))])
    sum_x_squared = sum([x[i] ** 2 for i in range(len(x))])
    n = len(x)
    return (n * sum_xy - sum(x) * sum(y)) / (n * sum_x_squared - sum(x) ** 2)


@task
def intercept(x: list[int], y: list[int], slope: float) -> float:
    mean_x = sum(x) / len(x)
    mean_y = sum(y) / len(y)
    intercept = mean_y - slope * mean_x
    return intercept

# Define a workflow to establish the task dependencies.
# Just like a task, a workflow is also strongly typed.
# %%
@workflow
def simple_wf(x: list[int], y: list[int]) -> float:
    slope_value = slope(x=x, y=y)
    intercept_value = intercept(x=x, y=y, slope=slope_value)
    return intercept_value


# %% [markdown]
# The {py:func}`~flytekit.workflow` decorator encapsulates Flyte tasks,
# essentially representing lazily evaluated promises.
# During parsing, function calls are deferred until execution time.
# These function calls generate {py:class}`~flytekit.extend.Promise`s that can be propagated to downstream functions,
# yet remain inaccessible within the workflow itself.
# The actual evaluation occurs when the workflow is executed.
#
# Workflows can be executed locally, resulting in immediate evaluation, or through tools like
# [`pyflyte`](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/flytekit/en/latest/pyflyte.html),
# [`flytectl`](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/flytectl/en/latest/index.html) or UI, triggering evaluation.
# While workflows decorated with `@workflow` resemble Python functions,
# they function as python-esque Domain Specific Language (DSL).
# When encountering a @task-decorated Python function, a promise object is created.
# This promise doesn't store the task's actual output. Its fulfillment only occurs during execution.
# Additionally, the inputs to a workflow are also promises, you can only pass promises into
# tasks, workflows and other Flyte constructs.
#
# :::{note}
# You can learn more about creating dynamic Flyte workflows by referring
# to {ref}`dynamic workflows <dynamic_workflows>`.
# In a dynamic workflow, unlike a simple workflow, the inputs are pre-materialized.
# However, each task invocation within the dynamic workflow still generates a promise that is evaluated lazily.
# Bear in mind that a workflow can have tasks, other workflows and dynamic workflows.
# :::
#
# You can run a workflow by calling it as you would with a Python function and providing the necessary inputs.

# %% [markdown]
# To run the workflow locally, you can use the following `pyflyte run` command:
# ```
# pyflyte run \
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks/master/examples/01_basics/01_basics/workflow.py \
#   simple_wf --x '[-3,0,3]' --y '[7,4,-2]'
# ```
#
# If you want to run it remotely on the Flyte cluster,
# simply add the `--remote flag` to the `pyflyte run` command:
# ```
# pyflyte run --remote \
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks/master/examples/01_basics/01_basics/workflow.py \
#   simple_wf --x '[-3,0,3]' --y '[7,4,-2]'
# ```
#
# While workflows are usually constructed from multiple tasks with dependencies established through
# shared inputs and outputs, there are scenarios where isolating the execution of a single task
# proves advantageous during the development and iteration of its logic.
# Crafting a new workflow definition each time for this purpose can be cumbersome.
# However, {ref}`executing an individual task <single_task_execution>` independently,
# without the confines of a workflow, offers a convenient approach for iterating on task logic effortlessly.
#
# ## Use `partial` to provide default arguments to tasks
# You can use the {py:func}`functools.partial` function to assign default or constant values to the parameters of your tasks.
