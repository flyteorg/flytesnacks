Setup a Project
----------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Make sure you have `git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ and
`python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ >= 3.7 installed.

Start a new project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ :

.. prompt:: bash $

    python -m venv ~/venvs/flyte
    source ~/venvs/flyte/bin/activate

Then install `Flytekit <https://pypi.org/project/flytekit/>`__ on it:

.. prompt:: bash (flyte)$

    pip install flytekit

Then run ``pyflyte init <project_name>``, where ``<project_name>`` is the
directory that will be created containing the scaffolding for a flyte-ready
project. For this guide we're going call it ``my_flyte_project``:

.. prompt:: bash (flyte)$

    pyflyte init my_flyte_project
    cd my_flyte_project

The ``my_flyte_project`` directory comes with a sample workflow, which can be
found under ``flyte/workflows/example.py``. The structure below shows the most
important files and how a typical Flyte app should be laid out.

.. dropdown:: A typical Flyte app should have these files

   .. code-block:: text

       my_flyte_project
       â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
       â”œâ”€â”€ docker_build_and_tag.sh
       â”œâ”€â”€ flyte
       â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
       â”‚         â””â”€â”€ workflows
       â”‚             â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
       â”‚             â””â”€â”€ example.py
       â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt

   .. note::

       * You can use `pip-compile` to build your requirements file.
       * The Dockerfile that comes with this is not GPU ready, but is a simple Dockerfile that should work for most of your apps.

Run the Workflow Locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The workflow can be run locally, simply by running it as a Python script:

.. prompt:: bash (flyte)$

    python flyte/workflows/example.py

.. note::

   The workflow needs to be invoked after the ``if __name__ == "__main__"``
   entrypoint at the bottom of ``flyte/workflows/example.py``.


Expected output:

.. prompt:: text

  Running my_wf() hello world


Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^^

We've successfully created a Flyte project and executed your workflows on a python runtime environment! ðŸŽ‰
Next, let's learn how to :ref:`deploy to the cloud <larger_apps_deploy>`.
