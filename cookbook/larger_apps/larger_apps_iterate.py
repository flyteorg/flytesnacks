Iterate and Re-deploy
----------------------

Modify Code and Test Locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Open ``example.py`` in your favorite editor.

   .. code-block::

       flyte/workflows/example.py

   .. dropdown:: flyte/workflows/example.py

      .. rli:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flytekit-python-template/simplify-template/myapp/workflows/example.py
         :language: python

#. Add ``name: str`` as an argument to both ``my_wf`` and ``say_hello`` functions. Then update the body of ``say_hello`` to consume that argument.

   .. code-block:: python

     @task
     def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
         return f"hello world, {name}"

   .. code-block:: python

     @workflow
     def my_wf(name: str) -> str:
         res = say_hello(name=name)
         return res

#. Update the simple test at the bottom of the file to pass in a name, e.g.

   .. code-block:: python

     print(f"Running my_wf(name='adam') {my_wf(name='adam')}")

#. When you run this file locally, it should output ``hello world, adam``.

   .. prompt:: bash (venv)$

     python flyte/workflows/example.py


   .. dropdown:: Expected output

       .. prompt:: text

            Running my_wf(name='adam') hello world, adam

#. Flytekit also provides ways to programmatically tests your tasks and workflows and provides easy mocking hooks to mock out certain functions.


[Bonus] Build & Deploy Your Application "Fast"er!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. To deploy this workflow to the Flyte cluster (sandbox), you can repeat the steps previously covered in :ref:`getting-started-build-deploy`. Flyte provides a **faster** way to iterate on your workflows. Since you have not updated any of the dependencies in your requirements file, it is possible to push just the code to Flyte backend without re-building the entire Docker container. To do so, run the following commands.

   .. prompt:: bash (venv)$

       pyflyte --pkgs flyte.workflows package --image myapp:v1 --fast --force

   .. note::

      ``--fast`` flag will take the code from your local machine and provide it for execution without having to build the container and push it. The ``--force`` flag allows overriding your previously created package.

   .. caution::

      The ``fast`` registration method can only be used if you do not modify any requirements (that is, you re-use an existing environment). But, if you add a dependency to your requirements file or env you have to follow the :ref:`getting-started-build-deploy` method.

#. The code can now be deployed using Flytectl, similar to what we've done previously. ``flytectl`` automatically understands that the package is for ``fast`` registration.
   For this to work, a new ``storage`` block has to be added to the Flytectl configuration with appropriate permissions at runtime. The storage block configures Flytectl to write to a specific ``S3 / GCS bucket``. If you're using the sandbox, this is automatically configured by Flytectl, so you can skip this for now. But do take a note for the future.

   .. prompt:: bash $

      flytectl register files --project flytesnacks --domain development --archive flyte-package.tgz  --version v1-fast1


   .. dropdown:: Flytectl configuration with ``storage`` block for Fast registration

            For other supported storage backends like Oracle, Azure, etc., refer to the configuration structure `here <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flyteorg/flytestdlib/storage#Config>`__.

#. Finally, visit `the sandbox console <http://localhost:30081/console/projects/flytesnacks/domains/development/workflows/flyte.workflows.example.my_wf>`__, click launch, and give your name as the input.

      :alt: A quick visual tour for launching a workflow and checking the outputs when they're done.

   Alternatively, use ``flytectl``. To pass arguments to the workflow, update the execution spec file (previously generated).

   #. Generate an execution spec file. This will prompt you to overwrite and answer 'y' on it.

      .. prompt:: bash $

       flytectl get launchplan --project flytesnacks --domain development flyte.workflows.example.my_wf --latest --execFile exec_spec.yaml

   #. Modify the execution spec file and update the input params and save the file. Notice that the version would be changed to your latest one.

      .. code-block:: yaml

         ....
         inputs:
          name: "adam"
         ....
         version: v1-fast1

   #. Create an execution using the exec spec file.

      .. prompt:: bash $

        flytectl create execution --project flytesnacks --domain development --execFile exec_spec.yaml

   #. Monitor the execution by providing the execution name from the ``create execution`` command.

      .. prompt:: bash $

         flytectl get execution --project flytesnacks --domain development <execname>


.. admonition:: Recap

  In this guide, you:

  1. Setup a Flyte project with ``pyflyte init my_flyte_project`` and
     ran your workflows locally.
  2. Started a Flyte sandbox cluster and ran a Flyte workflow on a cluster.
  4. Iterated on a Flyte workflow and updated the workflows on the cluster.
