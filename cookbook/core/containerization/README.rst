Containerization
----------------

As a container-native orchestration tool, all Flyte tasks are executed within isolated containers. ``Flytekit``
Python SDK enables you to configure these tasks for your needs easily, be it running a raw container with arbitrary
commands, specifying multiple container images in a single workflow, injecting secrets into a container, or using
spot instances.
