Using Secrets in a Task
=======================

.. tags:: Kubernetes, Intermediate

Flyte supports running a variety of tasks, from containers to SQL queries and
service calls, and it provides a native Secret construct to request and access
secrets.

This example explains how you can access secrets in a Flyte Task. Flyte provides
different types of secrets, but for users writing Python tasks, you can only access
secure secrets either as environment variables or as a file injected into the
running container.

# %%
# Creating Secrets with a Secrets Manager
# =======================================
#
# .. admonition:: Prerequisites
#    :class: important
#
#    - Install `kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/>`__.
#    - Have access to a Flyte cluster, for e.g. with ``flytectl demo start`` as
#      described :ref:`here <getting_started_flyte_cluster>`.
#
# The first step to using secrets in Flyte is to create one on the backend.
# By default, Flyte uses the K8s-native secrets manager, which we'll use in this
# example, but you can also :ref:`configure different secret managers <configure_secret_management>`.
#
# First, we use ``kubectl`` to create a secret called ``user-info`` with a
# ``user_secret`` key:
#
# .. prompt:: bash $
#
#    kubectl create secret -n <project>-<domain> generic user-info --from-literal=user_secret=mysecret
#
# .. note::
#
#    Be sure to specify the correct Kubernetes namespace when creating a secret. If you plan on accessing
#    the secret in the ``flytesnacks`` project under the ``development`` domain, replace ``<project>-<domain>``
#    with ``flytesnacks-development``. This is because secrets need to be in the same namespace as the
#    workflow execution.
#
# .. important::
#
#    The imperative command above is useful for creating secrets in an ad hoc manner,
#    but it may not be the most secure or sustainable way to do so. You can, however,
#    define secrets using a `configuration file <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/managing-secret-using-config-file/>`__
#    or tools like `Kustomize <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/managing-secret-using-kustomize/>`__.

# %%
# Using Secrets in Tasks
# ======================
#
# Once you've defined a secret on the Flyte backend, ``flytekit`` exposes a class
# called :py:class:`~flytekit.Secret`\s, which allows you to request a secret
# from the configured secret manager.

import os
from typing import Tuple

import flytekit
from flytekit import Secret, task, workflow
from flytekit.testing import SecretsManager

secret = Secret(
    group="<SECRET_GROUP>",
    key="<SECRET_KEY>",
    mount_requirement=Secret.MountType.ENV_VAR,
)

# %%
# Secrets consists of ``group``, ``key``, and ``mounting_requirement`` arguments,
# where a secret group can have multiple secrets associated with it.
# If the ``mounting_requirement`` argument is not specified, the secret will
# be injected as an environment variable by default.
#
# In the code below we specify two variables, ``SECRET_GROUP`` and
# ``SECRET_NAME``, which maps onto the ``user-info`` secret that we created
# with ``kubectl`` above, with a key called ``user_secret``.

SECRET_GROUP = "user-info"
SECRET_NAME = "user_secret"


# %%
# Now we declare the secret in the ``secret_requests`` argument of the
# :py:func:`@task <flytekit.task>` decorator. The request tells Flyte to make
# the secret available to the task.
#
# The secret can then be accessed inside the task using the
# :py:class:`~flytekit.ExecutionParameters` object, which is returned by
# invoking the :py:func:`flytekit.current_context` function, as shown below.
#
# At runtime, flytekit looks inside the task pod for an environment variable or
# a mounted file with a predefined name/path and loads the value.

@task(secret_requests=[Secret(group=SECRET_GROUP, key=SECRET_NAME)])
def secret_task() -> str:
    context = flytekit.current_context()
    secret_val = context.secrets.get(SECRET_GROUP, SECRET_NAME)
    print(secret_val)
    return secret_val

# %%
#
# .. warning::
#
#    Never print secret values! The example above is just for demonstration purposes.
#
# .. note::
#
#   - In case Flyte fails to access the secret, an error is raised.
#   - The ``Secret`` group and key are required parameters during declaration
#     and usage. Failure to specify will cause a :py:class:`ValueError`.
#
# Multiple Keys Grouped into One Secret
# -------------------------------------
#
# In some cases you may have multiple secrets and sometimes, they maybe grouped
# as one secret in the SecretStore.
#
# For example, In Kubernetes secrets, it is possible to nest multiple keys under
# the same secret:
#
# .. prompt:: bash $
#
#    kubectl create secret generic user-info \
#        --from-literal=user_secret=mysecret \
#        --from-literal=username=my_username \
#        --from-literal=password=my_password
#
# In this case, the secret group will be ``user-info``, with three available
# secret keys: ``user_secret``, ``username``, and ``password``.

USERNAME_SECRET = "username"
PASSWORD_SECRET = "password"


# %%
# The Secret structure allows passing two fields, matching the key and the group, as previously described:
@task(
    secret_requests=[
        Secret(key=USERNAME_SECRET, group=SECRET_GROUP),
        Secret(key=PASSWORD_SECRET, group=SECRET_GROUP),
    ]
)
def user_info_task() -> Tuple[str, str]:
    context = flytekit.current_context()
    secret_username = context.secrets.get(SECRET_GROUP, USERNAME_SECRET)
    secret_pwd = context.secrets.get(SECRET_GROUP, PASSWORD_SECRET)
    print(f"{secret_username}={secret_pwd}")
    return secret_username, secret_pwd


# %%
# .. warning::
#
#    Never print secret values! The example above is just for demonstration purposes.
#
# Mounting Secrets as Files or Environment Variables
# --------------------------------------------------
#
# It is also possible to make Flyte mount the secret as a file or an environment
# variable.
#
# The file type is useful for large secrets that do not fit in environment variables,
# which are typically asymmetric keys (like certs, etc). Another reason may be that a
# dependent library requires the secret to be available as a file.
# In these scenarios you can specify the ``mount_requirement=Secret.MountType.FILE``.
#
# In the following example we force the mounting to be an environment variable:

@task(
    secret_requests=[
        Secret(
            group=SECRET_GROUP,
            key=SECRET_NAME,
            mount_requirement=Secret.MountType.ENV_VAR,
        )
    ]
)
def secret_file_task() -> Tuple[str, str]:
    secret_manager = flytekit.current_context().secrets

    # get the secrets filename
    f = secret_manager.get_secrets_file(SECRET_GROUP, SECRET_NAME)

    # get secret value from an environment variable
    secret_val = secret_manager.get(SECRET_GROUP, SECRET_NAME)

    # returning the filename and the secret_val
    return f, secret_val


# %%
# These tasks can be used in your workflow as usual
@workflow
def my_secret_workflow() -> Tuple[str, str, str, str, str]:
    x = secret_task()
    y, z = user_info_task()
    f, s = secret_file_task()
    return x, y, z, f, s


# %%
# Testing with Mock Secrets
# -------------------------
#
# The simplest way to test secret accessibility is to export the secret as an
# environment variable. There are some helper methods available to do so:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sec = SecretsManager()
    os.environ[sec.get_secrets_env_var(SECRET_GROUP, SECRET_NAME)] = "value"
    os.environ[sec.get_secrets_env_var(SECRET_GROUP, USERNAME_SECRET)] = "username_value"
    os.environ[sec.get_secrets_env_var(SECRET_GROUP, PASSWORD_SECRET)] = "password_value"
    x, y, z, f, s = my_secret_workflow()
    assert x == "value"
    assert y == "username_value"
    assert z == "password_value"
    assert f == sec.get_secrets_file(SECRET_GROUP, SECRET_NAME)
    assert s == "value"

# %%
# Using Secrets in Task Templates
# ===============================
#
# For task types that connect to a remote database, you'll need to specify
# secret request as well. For example, for the :py:class:`~flytekitplugins.sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemyTask`
# you need to:
# 
# 1. Specify the ``secret_requests`` argument.
# 2. Configure the :py:class:`~flytekitplugins.sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemyConfig` to
#    declare which secret maps onto which connection argument.
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    from flytekit import kwtypes
#    from flytekitplugins.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyTask, SQLAlchemyConfig
#    
#    
#    # define the secrets
#    secrets = {
#        "username": Secret(group="<SECRET_GROUP>", key="<USERNAME_SECRET>"),
#        "password": Secret(group="<SECRET_GROUP>", key="<PASSWORD_SECRET>"),
#    }
#    
#    
#    sql_query = SQLAlchemyTask(
#        name="sql_query",
#        query_template="""SELECT * FROM my_table LIMIT {{ .inputs.limit }}""",
#        inputs=kwtypes(limit=int),
#    
#        # request secrets
#        secret_requests=[*secrets.values()],
#    
#        # specify username and password credentials in the configuration
#        task_config=SQLAlchemyConfig(
#            uri="<DATABASE_URI>",
#            secret_connect_args=secrets,
#        ),
#    )

# %%
# .. note::
#    
#    Here the ``secret_connect_args`` map to the
#    `SQLAlchemy engine configuration <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html>`__
#    argument names for the username and password.
#
# You can then use the ``sql_query`` task inside a workflow to grab data and
# perform downstream transformations on it.

# %%
# How Secrets Injection Works
# ===========================
#
# The rest of this page describes how secrets injection works under the hood.
# For a simple task that launches a Pod, the flow would look something like this:

#
# Breaking down this sequence diagram:
#
# 1. Flyte invokes a plugin to create the K8s object. This can be a Pod or a more complex CRD (e.g. Spark, PyTorch, etc.)
#
#    .. note:: The plugin ensures that the labels and annotations are passed to any Pod that is spawned due to the creation of the CRD.
#
# 2. Flyte applies labels and annotations that are referenced to all secrets the task is requesting access to. Note that secrets are not case sensitive.
# 3. Flyte sends a ``POST`` request to ``ApiServer`` to create the object.
# 4. Before persisting the Pod, ``ApiServer`` invokes all the registered Pod Webhooks and Flyte's Pod Webhook is called.
# 5. Using the labels and annotiations attached in *step *2**, Flyte Pod Webhook looks up globally mounted secrets for each of the requested secrets.
# 6. If found, the Pod Webhook mounts them directly in the Pod. If not found, the Pod Webhook injects the appropriate annotations to load the secrets for K8s (or Vault or Confidant or any secret management system plugin configured) into the task pod.
#
# Once the secret is injected into the task pod, Flytekit can read it using the secret manager.
#
# The webhook is included in all overlays in the Flytekit repo. The deployment file creates two things; a **Job** and a **Deployment**.
#
# 1) ``flyte-pod-webhook-secrets`` **Job**: This job runs ``flytepropeller webhook init-certs`` command that issues self-signed CA Certificate as well as a derived TLS certificate and its private key. Ensure that the private key is in lower case, that is, ``my_token`` in contrast to ``MY_TOKEN``. It stores them into a new secret ``flyte-pod-webhook-secret``.
# 2) ``flyte-pod-webhook`` **Deployment**: This deployment creates the Webhook pod which creates a MutatingWebhookConfiguration on startup. This serves as the registration contract with the ApiServer to know about the Webhook before it starts serving traffic.
#
# Secret Discovery
# ================
#
# Flyte identifies secrets using a secret group and a secret key, which can
# be accessed by :py:func:`flytekit.current_context` in the task function
# body, as shown in the code examples above.
#
# Flytekit relies on the following environment variables to load secrets (defined `here <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/9d313429c577a919ec0ad4cd397a5db356a1df0d/flytekit/configuration/internal.py#L141-L159>`_). When running tasks and workflows locally you should make sure to store your secrets accordingly or to modify these:
#
# - ``FLYTE_SECRETS_DEFAULT_DIR``: The directory Flytekit searches for secret files. **Default:** ``"/etc/secrets"``
# - ``FLYTE_SECRETS_FILE_PREFIX``: a common file prefix for Flyte secrets. **Default:** ``""``
# - ``FLYTE_SECRETS_ENV_PREFIX``: a common env var prefix for Flyte secrets. **Default:** ``"_FSEC_"``
#
# When running a workflow on a Flyte cluster, the configured secret manager will use the secret Group and Key to try and retrieve a secret.
# If successful, it will make the secret available as either file or environment variable and will if necessary modify the above variables automatically so that the task can load and use the secrets.
#
#
# .. _configure_secret_management:
#
# Configuring a Secret Management System Plugin
# =============================================
#
# When a task requests a secret, Flytepropeller will try to retrieve secrets in the following order:
#
# 1. Checking for global secrets, i.e. secrets mounted as files or environment variables on the ``flyte-pod-webhook`` pod
# 2. Checking with an additional configurable secret manager.
#
# .. important::
#
#    The global secrets take precedence over any secret discoverable by the secret manager plugins.
#
# The following secret managers are available at the time of writing:
#
# - `K8s secrets <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-a-secret>`__ (**default**): ``flyte-pod-webhook`` will try to look for a K8s secret named after the secret Group and retrieve the value for the secret Key.
# - `AWS Secret Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html>`__: ``flyte-pod-webhook`` will add the AWS Secret Manager sidecar container to a task Pod which will mount the secret.
# - `Vault Agent Injector <https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-first-secret#write-a-secret>`__ : ``flyte-pod-webhook`` will annotate the task Pod with the respective Vault annotations that trigger an existing Vault Agent Injector to retrieve the specified secret Key from a vault path defined as secret Group.
#
# You can configure the additional secret manager by defining ``secretManagerType`` to be either 'K8s', 'AWS' or 'Vault' in
# the `core config <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/blob/master/kustomize/base/single_cluster/headless/config/propeller/core.yaml#L34>`_ of the Flytepropeller.
#
# When using the K8s secret manager plugin, which is enabled by default, the secrets need to be available in the same namespace as the task execution
# (for example ``flytesnacks-development``). K8s secrets can be mounted as either files or injected as environment variables into the task pod,
# so if you need to make larger files available to the task, then this might be the better option.
#
# Furthermore, this method also allows you to have separate credentials for different domains but still using the same name for the secret.
#
# AWS Secrets Manager
# -------------------
#
# When using the AWS secret management plugin, secrets need to be specified by naming them in the format
# ``<SECRET_GROUP>:<SECRET_KEY>``, where the secret string is a plain-text value, **not** key/value json.
#
# Vault Secrets Manager
# ---------------------
#
# When using the Vault secret manager, make sure you have Vault Agent deployed on your cluster as described in this
# `step-by-step tutorial <https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-sidecar>`__.
# Vault secrets can only be mounted as files and will become available under ``"/etc/flyte/secrets/SECRET_GROUP/SECRET_NAME"``.
#
# Vault comes with `two versions <https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv>`__ of the key-value secret store.
# By default the Vault secret manager will try to retrieve **version 2** secrets. You can specify the KV version by setting
# ``webhook.vaultSecretManager.kvVersion`` in the configmap. Note that the version number needs to be an explicit string (e.g. ``"1"``).
# You can also configure the Vault role under which Flyte will try to read the secret by setting webhook.vaultSecretManager.role (default: ``"flyte"``).
#
# Scaling the Webhook
# ===================
#
# Vertical Scaling
# -----------------
#
# To scale the Webhook to be able to process the number/rate of pods you need, you may need to configure a vertical `pod
# autoscaler <https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler>`_.
#
# Horizontal Scaling
# -------------------
#
# The Webhook does not make any external API Requests in response to Pod mutation requests. It should be able to handle traffic
# quickly. For horizontal scaling, adding additional replicas for the Pod in the
# deployment should be sufficient. A single ``MutatingWebhookConfiguration`` object will be used, the same TLS certificate
# will be shared across the pods and the Service created will automatically load balance traffic across the available pods.
