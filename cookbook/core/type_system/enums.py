"""
Using Enum types
-------------------------

Sometimes you may want to restrict the set of inputs / outputs to a finite set of acceptable values. This is commonly
achieved using Enum types in programming languages.

Since version 0.15.0, Flyte supports Enum Types with string values. You can create a python Enum type and pass it to
a task or return from a task. Flyte will automatically convert this to and limit the inputs etc to a finite set of
values.

UX: flytectl will allow only the finite set of values to be acceptable and (in progress) UI will provide a drop-down for
the values.

**Caveat:** Only string values are supported as valid enum values. The first value in the list is assumed as the default
and the Enum types are not optional. So when defining enums, design them well to always make the first value as a
valid default.
