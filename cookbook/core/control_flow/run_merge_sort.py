Implementing Merge Sort
------------------------

FlyteIdl (the fundamental building block of the Flyte Language) allows various programming language features:
conditionals, recursion, custom typing, and more.

This tutorial will walk you through writing a simple Distributed Merge Sort algorithm. It'll show usage of conditions
as well as recursion using dynamically generated workflows. Flyte imposes limitation on the depth of the recursion to
avoid mis-use and potentially affecting the overall stability of the system.

# addition of the `@dynamic` annotation, this function will instead generate a plan of execution (a flyte workflow) with
# 4 different nodes that will all run remotely on potentially different hosts. Flyte takes care of ensuring references
# of data are properly passed around and order of execution is maintained with maximum possible parallelism.

# Putting it all together, this is the workflow that also serves as the entry point of execution. Given an unordered set
# of numbers, their length as well as the size at which to sort locally, it runs a condition on the size. The condition
# should look and flow naturally to a python developer. Binary arithmetic and logical operations on simple types as well
# as logical operations on conditions are supported. This condition checks if the current size of the numbers is below
# the cut-off size to run locally, if so, it runs the sort_locally task. Otherwise it runs the above dynamic workflow
# that recurse down the list.
