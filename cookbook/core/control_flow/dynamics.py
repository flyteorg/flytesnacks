Dynamic Workflows
=================

A workflow is typically static when the directed acyclic graph's (DAG) structure is known at compile-time.
However, in cases where a run-time parameter (for example, the output of an earlier task) determines the full DAG structure, you can use dynamic workflows by decorating a function with ``@dynamic``.

A dynamic workflow is similar to the :py:func:`~flytekit.workflow`, in that it represents a python-esque DSL to
declare task interactions or new workflows. One significant difference between a regular workflow and dynamic (workflow) is that
the latter is evaluated at runtime. This means the inputs are first materialized and sent to the actual function,
as if it were a task. However, the return value from a dynamic workflow is a Promise object instead of an actual value,
which is fulfilled by evaluating the various tasks invoked in the dynamic workflow.

Think of a dynamic workflow as a parent graph node that spins off new child nodes which would represent a new child graph. 
At runtime, dynamic workflows receive input and create new workflows. These new workflows have graph nodes. 

Within the ``@dynamic`` context (function), every invocation of a :py:func:`~flytekit.task` or a derivative of
:py:class:`~flytekit.core.base_task.Task` class will result in deferred evaluation using a promise, instead
of the actual value being materialized. You can also nest other ``@dynamic`` and ``@workflow`` constructs within this
task, but it is not possible to interact with the outputs of a ``task/workflow`` as they are lazily evaluated.
If you want to interact with the outputs, break up the logic in dynamic and create a new task to read and resolve the outputs.

Refer to :py:func:`~flytekit.dynamic` for documentation.

Here's a code example that counts the common characters between any two strings.

# Let's first import all the required libraries.

from flytekit import dynamic, task, workflow

# Next, we write a task that returns the index of a character (A-Z/a-z is equivalent to 0 to 25).
@task
def return_index(character: str) -> int:
    """
    Computes the character index (which needs to fit into the 26 characters list)"""
    if character.islower():
        return ord(character) - ord("a")
    else:
        return ord(character) - ord("A")


# %%
# We now write a task that prepares the 26-character list by populating the frequency of every character.
@task
def update_list(freq_list: typing.List[int], list_index: int) -> typing.List[int]:
    """
    Notes the frequency of characters"""
    freq_list[list_index] += 1
    return freq_list


# %%
# Next we find the number of common characters between the two strings.
@task
def derive_count(freq1: typing.List[int], freq2: typing.List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Derives the number of common characters"""
    count = 0
    for i in range(26):
        count += min(freq1[i], freq2[i])
    return count


# %%
# In this step, we perform the following:
#
# #. Initialize the empty 26-character list to be sent to the ``update_list`` task
# #. Loop through every character of the first string (s1) and populate the frequency list
# #. Loop through every character of the second string (s2) and populate the frequency list
# #. Derive the number of common characters by comparing the two frequency lists
#
# The looping is dependent on the number of characters of both the strings which aren't known until the run time. If the ``@task`` decorator is used to encapsulate the calls mentioned above, the compilation will fail very early on due to the absence of the literal values.
# Therefore, ``@dynamic`` decorator has to be used.
#
# Dynamic workflow is effectively both a task and a workflow. The key thing to note is that the _body of tasks is run at run time and the
# body of workflows is run at compile (aka registration) time. Essentially, this is what a dynamic workflow leverages -- it’s a workflow that is compiled at run time (the best of both worlds)!
#
# At execution (run) time, Flytekit runs the compilation step, and produces
# a ``WorkflowTemplate`` (from the dynamic workflow), which Flytekit then passes back to Flyte Propeller for further running, exactly how sub-workflows are handled.
#
# .. note::
#    The dynamic pattern isn't the most efficient method to iterate over a list. `Map tasks <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/8528268a29a07fe7e9ce9f7f08fea68c41b6a60b/flytekit/core/map_task.py/>`_
#    might be more efficient in certain cases. But they only work for Python tasks (tasks decorated with the @task decorator) not SQL, Spark, and so on.
#
# We now define a dynamic workflow that encapsulates the above mentioned points.
@dynamic
def count_characters(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    """

    # s1 and s2 are accessible

    # initialize an empty list consisting of 26 empty slots corresponding to every alphabet (lower and upper case)

    freq2 = [0] * 26

    # looping through the string s1
    for i in range(len(s1)):

        freq2 = update_list(freq_list=freq2, list_index=index)

    # counting the common characters
    return derive_count(freq1=freq1, freq2=freq2)


# %%
# When tasks are called within any workflow, they return Promise objects. Likewise, in a dynamic workflow, the tasks' outputs are Promise objects that cannot be directly accessed (they shall be fulfilled by Flyte later).
# Because of this fact, operations on the ``index`` variable like ``index + 1`` are not valid.
# To manage this problem, the values need to be passed to the other tasks to unwrap them.
#
# .. note:: The local execution will work when a ``@dynamic`` decorator is used because Flytekit treats it like a ``task`` that will run with the Python native inputs.
#
# Therefore, there are no Promise objects locally within the function decorated with ``@dynamic`` as it is treated as a ``task``\.

# Finally, we define a workflow that calls the dynamic workflow.

# Dynamic Workflows Under the Hood
# --------------------------------
#
# What Is a Dynamic Workflow?
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# A workflow whose directed acyclic graph (DAG) is computed at run-time is a :ref:`dynamic workflow <Dynamic Workflows>`. The tasks in a dynamic workflow are executed at runtime using dynamic inputs.
#
# Think of a dynamic workflow as a combination of a task and a workflow. It is used to dynamically decide the parameters of a workflow at runtime. It is both compiled and executed at run-time. You can define a dynamic workflow using the ``@dynamic`` decorator.
#
# Why Use Dynamic Workflows?
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Flexibility
# """""""""""
#
# Dynamic workflows simplify your pipelines, providing the flexibility to design workflows based on your project’s requirements, which can’t be achieved using static workflows.
#
# Lower Pressure on etcd
# """""""""""""""""""""""
#
# The workflow CRD and the states associated with static workflows are stored in etcd, which is the Kubernetes database. This database stores Flyte workflow CRD as key-value pairs and keeps track of the status of each node’s execution.
# A limitation of etcd is that there is a hard limit on the data size (data size refers to the aggregate of the size of the workflow and the status of the nodes).
# Due to this limitation, you need to ensure that your static workflows don’t consume too much memory.
#
# Dynamic workflows offload the workflow spec (node/task definitions and connections, etc) to the blobstore but the node statuses are stored in the FlyteWorkflow CRD (in etcd).
# Dynamic workflows alleviate a portion of etcd storage space thereby reducing pressure on etcd.
#
# How Is a Dynamic Workflow Executed?
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# FlytePropeller executes the dynamic task in its k8s pod and results in a compiled Flyte DAG which is made available in the FlyteConsole.
# FlytePropeller uses the information obtained by executing the dynamic task to schedule and execute every node within the dynamic task.
# You can visualize the dynamic workflow’s graph in the UI only after the dynamic task has completed execution.
#
# When a dynamic task is executed, it generates the entire workflow as its output. This output is known as the **futures file**.
# It is named so because the workflow is yet to be executed and all the subsequent outputs are futures.
#
# How Does Flyte Handle Dynamic Workflows?
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# A dynamic workflow is modeled as a task in the backend, but the body of the function is executed to produce a workflow at run-time. In both dynamic and static workflows, the output of tasks are Promise objects.
#
# .. note::
#   When a dynamic (or static) workflow calls a task, the workflow returns a :py:class:`Promise <flytekit.extend.Promise>` object. You can’t interact with this Promise object directly since it uses lazy evaluation (it defers the evaluation until absolutely needed). You can unwrap the Promise object by passing it to a task or a dynamic workflow.
#
# :ref:`Here <Predicting House Price in Multiple Regions Using XGBoost and Dynamic Workflows>` is an example of house price prediction using dynamic workflows.
#
# Where Are Dynamic Workflows Used?
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Dynamic workflow comes into the picture when you need to:
#
# #. Modify the logic of the code at runtime
# #. Change or decide on feature extraction parameters on-the-go
# #. Build AutoML pipelines
# #. Tune hyperparameters during execution
#
# Dynamic versus Map Tasks
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Dynamic tasks have overhead for large fan-out tasks because they store metadata for the entire workflow. In contrast, map tasks are efficient for these large fan-out tasks since they don’t store the metadata, as a consequence of which overhead is less apparent.
