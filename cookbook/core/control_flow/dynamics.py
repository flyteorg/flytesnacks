Dynamic Workflow
----------------

A workflow is typically static where the directed acyclic graph's (DAG) structure is known well ahead of time. However, scenarios could exist where an "unknown" variable only known at run-time could determine the proper DAG structure.

In such cases, dynamic workflows can be used. Here's a code example that counts the common characters between any two strings.

Inputs: s1 = "Pear", s2 = "Earth"

Output: 3

# Let's first import all the required libraries.

from flytekit import task, dynamic, workflow

    if character.islower():
        return ord(character) - ord("a")
    else:
        return ord(character) - ord("A")

# %%
# We now write a task that prepares the 26 characters list by populating the frequency of every character.
@task
def prepare_list(freq_list: typing.List[int], list_index: int) -> typing.List[int]:
    """
    Notes the frequency of characters"""
    freq_list[list_index] += 1
    return freq_list

    """
    Derives the number of common characters"""
    count = 0
    for i in range(26):
        count += min(freq1[i], freq2[i])
    return count

# %%
# In this step, we perform the following:
#
# #. Initialize empty 26 characters list to be sent to the ``prepare_list`` task
# #. Loop through every character of the first string (s1) and populate the frequency list
# #. Loop through every character of the second string (s2) and populate the frequency list
# #. Derive the number of common characters by comparing the two frequency lists
#
# The looping is dependent on the number of characters of both the strings which aren't known until the run time. If the ``@task`` decorator is used to encapsulate the calls mentioned above, the compilation will fail very early on due to the absence of the literal values.
# Therefore, ``@dynamic`` decorator has to be used. 
# 
# Dynamic workflow is effectively both a task and a workflow. The key thing to note is that the ``body of tasks is run at run time and the
# body of workflows is run at compile (aka registration) time``. Essentially, this is what a dynamic workflow leverages -- itâ€™s a workflow that is compiled at run time (the best of both worlds)! 
# 
# At execution (run) time, flytekit runs the compilation step, and produces
# a ``WorkflowTemplate`` (from the dynamic workflow), which flytekit then passes back to Flyte Propeller for further running, much like how sub-workflows are handled. 
#
# We now define the dynamic workflow encapsulating the above mentioned points.

# When tasks are called within any workflow, they return Promise objects. Likewise, in a dynamic workflow, the tasks' outputs are Promise objects that cannot be directly accessed (they shall be fulfilled by Flyte later). To get around this problem, the values need to be passed to the other tasks to unwrap them.
#
# A point to note is, local execution will work when a ``@dynamic`` decorator is used because Flytekit treats it like a task that shall run with the Python native inputs.
