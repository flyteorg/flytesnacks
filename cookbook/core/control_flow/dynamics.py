Dynamic Workflows
------------------

A workflow is typically static where the directed acyclic graph's (DAG) structure is known at compile-time.
However, in cases where a run-time parameter (e.g. the output of an earlier task) determines the full DAG structure, you can use dynamic workflows by decorating a function with ``@dynamic``.

A dynamic workflow is similar to the :py:func:`~flytekit.workflow`, in that it represents a python-esque DSL to
declare task interactions or new workflows. One significant difference between a regular workflow and dynamic (workflow) is that
the latter is evaluated at runtime. This means that the inputs are first materialized and sent to the actual function,
as if it were a task. However, the return value from a dynamic workflow is a promise rather than an actual value,
which can be fulfilled by evaluating the various tasks that were invoked in the dynamic workflow.

Within the ``@dynamic`` context (function), every invocation of a :py:func:`~flytekit.task` or a derivative of
:py:class:`~flytekit.core.base_task.Task` class will result in deferred evaluation using a promise, instead
of the actual value being materialized. You can also nest other ``@dynamic`` and ``@workflow`` constructs within this
task, but it is not possible to interact with the outputs of a ``task/workflow`` as they are lazily evaluated.
If you want to interact with the outputs, break up the logic in dynamic and create a new task to read and resolve the outputs.

Refer to :py:func:`~flytekit.dynamic` for more documentation.

Here's a code example that counts the common characters between any two strings.

# Let's first import all the required libraries.
import typing

from flytekit import dynamic, task, workflow

# %%
# Next, we write a task that returns the index of a character (A-Z/a-z is equivalent to 0 to 25).
@task
def return_index(character: str) -> int:
    """
    Computes the character index (which needs to fit into the 26 characters list)"""
    if character.islower():
        return ord(character) - ord("a")
    else:
        return ord(character) - ord("A")


# %%
# We now write a task that prepares the 26-character list by populating the frequency of every character.
@task
def update_list(freq_list: typing.List[int], list_index: int) -> typing.List[int]:
    """
    Notes the frequency of characters"""
    freq_list[list_index] += 1
    return freq_list


# %%
# Next we find the number of common characters between the two strings.
@task
def derive_count(freq1: typing.List[int], freq2: typing.List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Derives the number of common characters"""
    count = 0
    for i in range(26):
        count += min(freq1[i], freq2[i])
    return count


# %%
# In this step, we perform the following:
#
# #. Initialize the empty 26-character list to be sent to the ``update_list`` task
# #. Loop through every character of the first string (s1) and populate the frequency list
# #. Loop through every character of the second string (s2) and populate the frequency list
# #. Derive the number of common characters by comparing the two frequency lists
#
# The looping is dependent on the number of characters of both the strings which aren't known until the run time. If the ``@task`` decorator is used to encapsulate the calls mentioned above, the compilation will fail very early on due to the absence of the literal values.
# Therefore, ``@dynamic`` decorator has to be used.
#
# Dynamic workflow is effectively both a task and a workflow. The key thing to note is that the _body of tasks is run at run time and the
# body of workflows is run at compile (aka registration) time. Essentially, this is what a dynamic workflow leverages -- itâ€™s a workflow that is compiled at run time (the best of both worlds)!
#
# At execution (run) time, Flytekit runs the compilation step, and produces
# a ``WorkflowTemplate`` (from the dynamic workflow), which Flytekit then passes back to Flyte Propeller for further running, exactly how sub-workflows are handled.
#
# .. note:: 
#    The dynamic pattern isn't the most efficient method to iterate over a list. `Map tasks <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/8528268a29a07fe7e9ce9f7f08fea68c41b6a60b/flytekit/core/map_task.py/>`_ 
# might be more efficient in certain cases. But they only work for Python tasks (tasks decorated with the @task decorator) not SQL/Spark/etc,.
#
# We now define a dynamic workflow that encapsulates the above mentioned points.

# %%
# When tasks are called within any workflow, they return Promise objects. Likewise, in a dynamic workflow, the tasks' outputs are Promise objects that cannot be directly accessed (they shall be fulfilled by Flyte later).
# Because of this fact, operations on the ``index`` variable like ``index + 1`` are not valid.
# To manage this problem, the values need to be passed to the other tasks to unwrap them.
#
# .. note:: The local execution will work when a ``@dynamic`` decorator is used because Flytekit treats it like a ``task`` that will run with the Python native inputs.
# Therefore, there are no Promise objects locally within the function decorated with ``@dynamic`` as it is treated as a ``task``.
