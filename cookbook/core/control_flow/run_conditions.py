Conditions
--------------
Flytekit supports conditions as a first class construct in the language. Conditions offer a way to selectively execute
branches of a workflow based on static or dynamic data produced by other tasks or come in as workflow inputs.
Conditions are very performant to be evaluated however, they are limited to certain binary and logical operators and can
only be performed on primitive values.

# Example 1
# ^^^^^^^^^
# In the following example we define two tasks `square` and `double` and depending on whether the workflow input is a
# fraction (0-1) or not, it decided which to execute.

# Example 2
# ^^^^^^^^^
# In the following example we have an if condition with multiple branches and we fail if no conditions are met. Flyte
# expects any conditional() statement to be _complete_ meaning all possible branches have to be handled.

# .. note::
#
#   Notice the use of bitwise (&). Python (PEP-335) does not allow overloading of Logical ``and, or, not`` operators. Flytekit uses bitwise `&` and `|` as logical and and or. This is a common practice in other libraries as well.
