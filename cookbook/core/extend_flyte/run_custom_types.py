Writing Custom Flyte Types
--------------------------

Flyte is a strongly-typed framework for authoring tasks and workflows. But there are situations when the existing set
of types do not directly work. In fact, this is true with any programming language!

Just like a programming language enabling higher-level concepts to describe user-specific objects - like classes in Python/Java/C++, struct in C/Golang, etc.,
Flytekit allows modeling user classes. The idea is to make an interface that is more productive for the
use case, but write a transformer that transforms the user-defined type to one of the generic constructs in Flyte's type system.

This example will try to model an example user-defined dataset and show how it can be integrated seamlessly with Flytekit's typing engine.

The video below will walk you through the example.
