"""
Single Node GPU training
-------------------------
Training a model on a single node on one gpu is as trivial as writing any Flyte task and simply setting the GPU='1'.
As long as the docker image is built correctly with the right version of the GPU drivers and your Flyte backend is
provisioned to have GPU machines, Flyte will execute your task on a node that has GPU's.

Currently Flyte does not provide any specific task type for Pytorch (though it is entire possible to provide a task-type
that supports pytorch-ignite or pytorch-lightening support, but this is not critical). You can request for a GPU, simply
by setting the GPU="1" resource request and then at runtime you will receive a GPU.

This example shows how you can create any Pytorch model and train it using Flyte and your specialized container. Flyte
will handle the data passing and can export the model out of the training environment.

# Tensorboard and are the output of the `SummaryWriter` interface
# Refer to section :ref:`pytorch_tensorboard` to visualize the outputs of this example.

#
#    Note the usage of requests=Resources(gpu="1"). This will force Flyte to allocate this task onto a machine with GPUs
#    The task will be queued up until a machine with gpu's can be procured. Also for the GPU Training to work, the
#    dockerfile needs to be built as explained in the :ref:`pytorch-training` section.
