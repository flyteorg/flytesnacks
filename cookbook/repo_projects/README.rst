Repo-based Projects
--------------------

So far in the **User Guide** you've been running Flyte workflows using
*script mode*, which is useful for quick prototyping and running one-off scripts
on a Flyte cluster. However, if you need to build a larger Flyte project
with sub-modules or sub-packages to organize the logic of your tasks and
workflows, you can use `flyte python templates <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit-python-template>`__
to quickly create a repo-based Flyte project.
