# raw-containers-demo

This directory holds the Dockerfiles and supporting files needed to run the example described in `raw_container.py`, split by language.

The actual example points to images present in the gihub registry (i.e. ghcr.io), so in case we need to update the examples for any reason we should keep in mind to push them to ghcr too.
