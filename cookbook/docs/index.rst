These tutorials are intended to help the user learn by example. We start with various concepts in flyte and flytekit with examples and
then introduce some of the core plugins. This cookbook is designed to get you running both locally, and on a Flyte cluster using
the `Flytekit Python SDK <https://github.com/lyft/flytekit>`__.
