Tutorials
=========
These tutorials are intended to help the user learn by example. We start with various concepts in flyte and flytekit with examples and
then introduce some of the core plugins. This cookbook is designed to get you running both locally, and on a Flyte cluster using
`Flytekit Python <https://github.com/lyft/flytekit>`__

All the examples are authored using `Flytekit Python <https://github.com/lyft/flytekit>`__ and are designed to be run-locally (this may not be possible for some plugins) or on a Flyte cluster.

The tutorial is divided into 3 sections:

* :ref:`Core Language Examples <flyte-core>` - This covers the basics of Flytekit, as well as working with a deployed Flyte platform.
* :ref:`Case Studies <sphx_glr_auto_case_studies>` - These are examples that showcase the power of Flyte.
* :ref:`Plugins Examples <plugins_main>` - This section details flytekit extensibility

For more details on Flyte refer to the `Homepage <https://flyte.org>`__. For documentation on how to install, configure, administer Flyte, please refer to the
`platform documentation <https://lyft.github.io/flyte/>`__

Please report bugs, suggestions, or comments by creating a `GitHub issue <https://github.com/lyft/flyte/issues/new/choose>`_ or just by opening a PR against this or any Flyte repo.
It is our hope new contributors find the community welcoming!
