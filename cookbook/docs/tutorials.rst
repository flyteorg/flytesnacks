This section showcases step-by-step case studies of how to combine the different features of Flyte to achieve everything
from data processing, feature engineering, model training, to batch predictions. Code for all of the examples in the
user guide can be found in the `flytesnacks repo <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks>`_.

`Flytesnacks <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks>`_ comes with a highly customized environment to make running,
documenting and contributing samples easy. If this is your first time running these examples, follow the
:ref:`setup guide <setup_flytesnacks_env>` to get started.
