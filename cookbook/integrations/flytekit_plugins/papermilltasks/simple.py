"""
Execute a Python Script as a Jupyter notebook
-----------------------------------------------
In this example, we will show how to create a flyte task, that runs a simple notebook, that accepts one input variable, transforms it and produces
one output. This can be generalized to multiple inputs and outputs.

# How to specify inputs and outputs
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# #. After you are satisfied with the notebook, ensure that the first cell is just the input variables for the notebook. Now add a tag ``parameters`` for the first cell.
#

#     :alt: Example of "parameters tag" added to the cell with input variables
#
# #. Now usually as the last cell of the notebook (does not need to be the last cell), add a tag ``outputs`` for the intended cell.
#
# .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flyte/static-resources/img/papermilltasks/outputs.png
#     :alt: Example of "parameters tag" added to the cell with input variables
#
# #. Now in a python file, you have to create a new task at the ``module`` level.
#    The example task is shown below
nb = NotebookTask(
    name="simple-nb",
    notebook_path=os.path.join(
        pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute(), "nb-simple.ipynb"
    ),
    inputs=kwtypes(v=float),
    outputs=kwtypes(square=float),
)
#%%
# .. note::
#
#  - Note the notebook_path. It is the absolute path to the actual notebook.
#  - Note the inputs and outputs. The variable names match the variable names in the jupyter notebook.
#
# Other tasks
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# You can ofcourse declare other tasks and seamlessly work with notebook tasks, let us declare a task that accepts the squared value from the notebook and provides a sqrt
@task
def square_root_task(f: float) -> float:
    return math.sqrt(f)


#%%
# You can now treat the notebook task as a regular task
@workflow
def nb_to_python_wf(f: float) -> float:
    out = nb(v=f)
    return square_root_task(f=out.square)


#%%
# You can execute the task locally as well
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(nb_to_python_wf(f=3.14))

#%%
# 3 outputs - Why?
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# On executing you should see 3 outputs instead of the expected one. This is because this task generates 2 implicit outputs.
# One of them is the executed notebook (captured) and a rendered (HTML) of the executed notebook. In this case they are called
# ``nb-simple-out.ipynb`` and ``nb-simple-out.html`` respectively
