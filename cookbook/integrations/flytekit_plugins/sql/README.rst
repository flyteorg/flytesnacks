Flyte tasks are not always restricted to running user-supplied containers, nor even containers at all. Indeed, this is
one of the most important design decisions in Flyte. Non-container tasks can have arbitrary targets for execution -- 
an API that executes SQL queries like SnowFlake, BigQuery, a synchronous WebAPI, etc.
