# IdP Configuration
# *****************
# Flyte Admin requires that the application in your identity provider be configured as a web client (i.e. with a client secret). We recommend allowing the application to be issued a refresh token to avoid interrupting the user's flow by frequently redirecting to the IdP.
#
# *************************
# Flyte Admin Configuration
# *************************
# Please refer to the `inline documentation <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/blob/eaca2fb0e6018a2e261e9e2da8998906477cadb5/pkg/auth/config/config.go>`_ on the ``Config`` object in the ``auth`` package for a discussion on the settings required.
#
# **********************
# Example Configurations
# **********************
#
# Below are listed some canonical examples of how to set up some of the common IdPs to secure your Fyte services. OpenID Connect enables users to authenticate, in the
# browser, with an existing IdP. Flyte also allows connecting to an external OAuth2 Authorization Server to allow centrally managed third party app access.
# 
# OpenID Connect
# ===============
#
# OpenID Connect allows users to authenticate to Flyte in their browser using a familiar authentication provider (perhaps an organization-wide configured IdP).
# Flyte supports connecting with external OIdC providers. Here are some examples for how to set these up:
#
# Google OpenID Connect
# ---------------------
#
# Follow `Google Docs <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect>`__ on how to configure the IdP for OpenIDConnect.
#
# .. note::
#
#   Make sure to create an OAuth2 Client Credential. The `client_id` and `client_secret` will be needed in the following
#   steps.
#
# Okta OpenID Connect
# -------------------
#
# Okta supports OpenID Connect protocol and the creation of custom OAuth2 Authorization Servers, allowing it to act as both the user and apps IdP.
# It offers more detailed control on access policies, user consent, and app management.
#
# 1. If you don't already have an Okta account, sign up for one `here <https://developer.okta.com/signup/>`__
# 2. Create an app (choose Web for the platform) and OpenID Connect for the sign-on method
# 3. Add Login redirect URIs (e.g. http://localhost:30081/callback for sandbox or https://<your deployment url>/callback)
# 4. OPTIONAL: Add logout redirect URIs (e.g. http://localhost:30081/logout for sandbox)
# 5. Write down the Client ID and Client Secret
# 
# KeyCloak OpenID Connect
# ------------------------
#
# `KeyCloak <https://www.keycloak.org/>`__ is an open source solution for authentication, it supports both OpenID Connect and OAuth2 protocols (among others). 
# KeyCloak can be configured to be both the OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Authorization Server provider for Flyte.
#
# Apply configuration
# -------------------
#
# 1. Store the `client_secret` in a k8s secret as follows:
#
.. prompt:: bash

  kubectl edit secret -n flyte flyte-admin-auth

# %
# Add a new key under `stringData`:

.. code-block:: yaml

  stringData:
    oidc_client_secret: <client_secret> from the previous step
  data:
    ...
# %
# Save and close your editor.
#
# 2. Edit FlyteAdmin config to add `client_id` and configure auth as follows:

.. prompt:: bash

  kubectl get deploy -n flyte flyteadmin -o yaml | grep "name: flyte-admin-config"

# %
# This will output the name of the config map where the `client_id` needs to go.
#
.. prompt:: bash

  kubectl edit configmap -n flyte <the name of the config map from previous command>
# %
# Follow the inline comments to make the necessary changes:
#
.. code-block:: yaml

  server:
    ...
    security:
      secure: false
      # 1. Enable Auth by turning useAuth to true
      useAuth: true
      ...
  auth:
    userAuth:
      openId:
        # 2. Put the URL of the OpenID Connect provider.
        #    baseUrl: https://accounts.google.com # Uncomment for Google
        baseUrl: https://dev-14186422.okta.com/oauth2/default # Okta with a custom Authorization Server
        scopes:
          - profile
          - openid
          # - offline_access # Uncomment if OIdC supports issuing refresh tokens.
        # 3. Replace with the client ID created for Flyte.
        clientId: 0oakkheteNjCMERst5d6

# %
# Save and exit your editor.
#
# 3. Restart `flyteadmin` for the changes to take effect:
#
.. prompt:: bash

  kubectl rollout restart deployment/flyteadmin -n flyte

# %
# OAuth2 Authorization Server
# ===========================
#
# An OAuth2 Authorization Server allows external clients to request to authenticate and act on behalf of users (or as their own identities). Having 
# an OAuth2 Authorization Server enables Flyte administrators control over which apps can be installed and what scopes they are allowed to request or be granted (i.e. what privileges can they assume).
#
# Flyte comes with a built-in authorization server that can be statically configured with a set of clients to request and act on behalf of the user.
# The default clients are defined `here <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/pull/168/files#diff-1267ff8bd9146e1c0ff22a9e9d53cfc56d71c1d47fed9905f95ed4bddf930f8eR74-R100>`__ 
# and the corresponding section can be modified through configs.
#
# To set up an external OAuth2 Authorization Server, please follow the instructions below:
#
# Okta IdP
# --------
#
# 1. Under security -> API, click `Add Authorization Server`. Set the audience to the public URL of flyte admin (e.g. https://flyte.mycompany.io/).
# 2. Under `Access Policies`, click `Add New Access Policy` and walk through the wizard to allow access to the authorization server.
# 3. Under `Scopes`, click `Add Scope`. Set the name to `all` (required) and check `Require user consent for this scope` (recommended).
# 4. Create 2 apps (for fltyectl and flytepropeller) to enable these clients to communicate with the service.
#   Flytectl should be created as a `native client`.
#    FlytePropeller should be created as an `OAuth Service` and note the client ID and client Secrets provided.
#
# KeyCloak IdP
# ------------
#
# `KeyCloak <https://www.keycloak.org/>`__ is an open source solution for authentication, it supports both OpenID Connect and OAuth2 protocols (among others). 
# KeyCloak can be configured to be both the OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Authorization Server provider for flyte.
#
# Apply Configurations
# --------------------
#
# It is possible to direct Flyte admin to use an external authorization server. To do so, edit the same config map once more and follow these changes:
#
.. code-block:: yaml

    auth:
        appAuth:
            # 1. Choose External if you will use an external Authorization Server (e.g. a Custom Authorization server in Okta)
            #    Choose Self (or omit the value) to use Flyte Admin's internal (albeit limited) Authorization Server.
            authServerType: External

            # 2. Optional: Set external auth server baseUrl if different from OpenId baseUrl.
            externalAuthServer:
                baseUrl: https://dev-14186422.okta.com/oauth2/auskngnn7uBViQq6b5d6
        thirdPartyConfig:
            flyteClient:
                # 3. Replace with a new Native Client ID provisioned in the custom authorization server
                clientId: flytectl

                redirectUri: https://localhost:53593/callback
                
                # 4. "all" is a required scope and must be configured in the custom authorization server
                scopes:
                - offline
                - all
        userAuth:
            openId:
                baseUrl: https://dev-14186422.okta.com/oauth2/auskngnn7uBViQq6b5d6 # Okta with a custom Authorization Server
                scopes:
                - profile
                - openid
                # - offline_access # Uncomment if OIdC supports issuing refresh tokens.
                clientId: 0oakkheteNjCMERst5d6

# %
# 1. Store flyte propeller's `client_secret` in a k8s secret as follows:
#
.. prompt:: bash

  kubectl edit secret -n flyte flyte-propeller-auth

# %
# Add a new key under `stringData`:
#
.. code-block:: yaml

  stringData:
    client_secret: <client_secret> from the previous step
  data:
    ...

# %
# Save and close your editor.
#
# 2. Edit FlytePropeller config to add `client_id` and configure auth as follows:
#
.. prompt:: bash

  kubectl get deploy -n flyte flytepropeller -o yaml | grep "name: flyte-propeller-config"

# %
# This will output the name of the config map where the `client_id` needs to go.
#
.. prompt:: bash

  kubectl edit configmap -n flyte <the name of the config map from previous command>

# %
# Follow the inline comments to make the necessary changes:
#
.. code-block:: yaml

    admin:
        # 1. Replace with the client_id provided by the OAuth2 Authorization Server above.
        clientId: flytepropeller

# %
# Close the editor
# 
# 3. Restart `flytepropeller` for the changes to take effect:
#
.. prompt:: bash

  kubectl rollout restart deployment/flytepropeller -n flyte
# %
# ***************************
# Continuous Integration - CI
# ***************************
#
# If your organization does any automated registration, then you'll need to authenticate with the `basic authentication <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617>`_ flow (username and password effectively). After retrieving an access token from the IDP, you can send it along to Flyte Admin as usual.
#
# Flytekit configuration variables are automatically designed to look up values from relevant environment variables. However, to aid with continuous integration use-cases, Flytekit configuration can also reference other environment variables. 
#
# For instance, if your CI system is not capable of setting custom environment variables like ``FLYTE_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_SECRET`` but does set the necessary settings under a different variable, you may use ``export FLYTE_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_ENV_VAR=OTHER_ENV_VARIABLE`` to redirect the lookup. A ``FLYTE_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_FILE`` redirect is available as well, where the value should be the full path to the file containing the value for the configuration setting, in this case, the client secret. We found this redirect behavior necessary when setting up registration within our own CI pipelines.
#
# The following is a listing of the Flytekit configuration values we set in CI, along with a brief explanation.
#
# * ``FLYTE_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_ID`` and ``FLYTE_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_SECRET``
#   When using basic authentication, this is the username and password.
# * ``export FLYTE_CREDENTIALS_AUTH_MODE=basic``
#   This tells the SDK to use basic authentication. If not set, Flytekit will assume you want to use the standard OAuth based three-legged flow.
# * ``export FLYTE_CREDENTIALS_AUTHORIZATION_METADATA_KEY=text``
#   At Lyft, the value is set to conform to this `header config <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/blob/eaca2fb0e6018a2e261e9e2da8998906477cadb5/pkg/auth/config/config.go#L53>`_ on the Admin side.
# * ``export FLYTE_CREDENTIALS_SCOPE=text``
#   When using basic authentication, you'll need to specify a scope to the IDP (instead of ``openid``, which is only for OAuth). Set that here.
# * ``export FLYTE_PLATFORM_AUTH=True``
#   Set this to force Flytekit to use authentication, even if not required by Admin. This is useful as you're rolling out the requirement.
